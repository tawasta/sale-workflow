===============================
Sale Order – Search multi value
===============================

This module was created to search multiple sale orders by their
name. Searching is made easier if a user wants to copy a list
of sale order names to the search bar.

Configuration
=============
No special configuration is required.

Usage
=====
One good way to use this module is to copy a list of sale order
names from excel for example to sale order search bar. Select
the term 'Multiple search' and those sale orders will be shown.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
Upon development no possible issues with other modules
were noticed.
